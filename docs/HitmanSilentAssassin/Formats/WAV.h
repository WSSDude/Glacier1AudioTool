// Header partially defines structure of WAV files used by Hitman Silent Assassin.
// It is specific for Hitman Silent Assassin, it is written as simply as possible wihtout using anything fancy,
// with any information I had about each field written next to it.
//
// It represents audio streams data, shared between multiple scenes. 
// Streams readability may be dependent on WHD information also, similiarly to other Glacier 1 games, needs to be checked.
