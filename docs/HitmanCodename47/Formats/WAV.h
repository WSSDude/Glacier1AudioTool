// Header partially defines structure of WAV files used by Hitman Blood Money.
// It is specific for Hitman Blood Money, it is written as simply as possible wihtout using anything fancy,
// with any information I had about each field written next to it.
//
// Repeat.WAV represents audio streams data, shared between multiple scenes. There is also PackRepeat.WAV 
// with different structure which sounds like it should reference Repeat.WAV. It is unknown exactly where 
// to take filenames from.
