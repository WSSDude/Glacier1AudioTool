// Header partially defines structure of WHD+WAV files used by Hitman Blood Money.
// It is specific for Hitman Blood Money, it is written as simply as possible wihtout using anything fancy,
// with any information I had about each field written next to it.
//
// The pair represents sound data for specific scene with same name. They can't be opened without each other.
// Scene WAV files do not contain any sort of header, only blobs of simple data. Scene WHD files contain all
// header information of all sound data required for the given scene. This data may be contained in scene or
// in stream STR file.
//
// Both of these scene files are completely aligned on 16 bytes.
//
// WHD file does not has any known direct pointers into at the time of writting. Best method may not be best after more
// of SND file is reverse engineered as it looks to contain some additional sound information in form of sound data graphs. 
// For now, below is very stable algorithm without sideeffects you can use to parse scene WHD+WAV pairs (TODO - already outdated,
// needs an update!). Algorithm was verified with ton of assertions, bunch of which are still left in G1AT for debug builds. Also, 
// great care was taken to make sure algorithm doesn't go out of bounds anywhere (only exception is aliased stream entry, which was 
// done for simplification and as this was proven to work without sideeffects).
//
// How to parse (TODO - already outdated, needs an update!):
// - read in WHD_Header and validate known fields
// - while not WHD_Header.fileSizeWithHeader offset reached
//   - go to the end of a string, including single byte for null terminator
//   - make sure you ended up on aligned address on 16 byte boundary and if not, add enough bytes to offset to be aligned
//   - try to read in WHD_Record
//     - if any of the last 12 bytes is not null, queue checkValidHeader()
//     - if another 4 bytes from end are not null and first four bytes are not 'PHO\0', queue checkValidHeader()
//     - if queued checkValidHeader(), check that first four bytes are null
//       - if not, set reset read offset to the point before "try to read in WHD_Record" and go back to 
//         "while not WHD_Header.fileSizeWithHeader offset reached"
//       - if yes, subtract 12 bytes from read offset and continue
//     - either check passed with 12 subtracted bytes or this is another iteration of the loop where nothing failed
//     - we can read in first 4 bytes of WHD_Record now and determine record subtype
//     - if after read offset points to null byte, repeat single time from "try to read in WHD_Record"
//     - otherwise, if this is second iteration of block "try to read in WHD_Record", subtract 8 bytes from read offset
// - WHD file parsing finished
