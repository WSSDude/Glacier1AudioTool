// Header partially defines structure of WHD+WAV files used by Hitman Blood Money.
// It is specific for Hitman Blood Money, it is written as simply as possible wihtout using anything fancy,
// with any information I had about each field written next to it.
//
// It represents sound data for specific scene with same name. They can't be opened without each other.
// It is required to properly parse data in STR and scene WAV files. STR requires this to properly discard extraneous
// aliased entry. Scene WAV files do not contain any sort of header information and need information from WHD to be 
// usable.
//
// The file does not has any known direct pointers into at the time of writting. Best method may not be best after more
// of SND file is reverse engineered. For now, below is very stable algorithm without sideeffects you can use to parse
// WHD files. Algorithm was verified with ton of assertions, bunch of which are still left in G1AT for debug builds.
//
// Whole file is aligned on 16 bytes. This applies to both, WHD and WAV scene files.
//
// How to parse:
// - read in WHD_Header and validate known fields
// - while not WHD_Header.fileSizeWithHeader offset reached
//   - go to the end of a string, including single byte for null terminator
//   - make sure you ended up on aligned address on 16 byte boundary and if not, add enough bytes to offset to be aligned
//   - try to read in WHD_Record
//     - if any of the last 12 bytes is not null, queue checkValidHeader()
//     - if another 4 bytes from end are not null and first four bytes are not 'PHO\0', queue checkValidHeader()
//     - if queued checkValidHeader(), check that first four bytes are null
//       - if not, set reset read offset to the point before "try to read in WHD_Record" and go back to 
//         "while not WHD_Header.fileSizeWithHeader offset reached"
//       - if yes, subtract 12 bytes from read offset and continue
//     - either check passed with 12 subtracted bytes or this is another iteration of the loop where nothing failed
//     - we can read in first 4 bytes of WHD_Record now and determine record subtype
//     - if after read offset points to null byte, repeat single time from "try to read in WHD_Record"
//     - otherwise, if this is second iteration of block "try to read in WHD_Record", subtract 8 bytes from read offset
// - WHD file parsing finished
