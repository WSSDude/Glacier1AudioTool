// Header partially defines structure of STR files used by Hitman Blood Money.
// It is specific for Hitman Blood Money, it is written as simply as possible wihtout using anything fancy,
// with any information I had about each field written next to it.
//
// It represents audio streams data, shared between multiple scenes.
// Streams readability may be dependent on WHD information also, similiarly to previous games, needs to be checked.
