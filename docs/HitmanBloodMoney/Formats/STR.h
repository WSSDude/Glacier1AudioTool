// Header partially defines structure of STR files used by Hitman Blood Money.
// It is specific for Hitman Blood Money, it is written as simply as possible wihtout using anything fancy,
// with any information I had about each field written next to it.
//
// It represents audio streams data, shared between multiple scenes.
// Streams readability may be dependent on WHD information also, similiarly to previous games, needs to be checked.
//
// String table is located right before entry table begins, it is not aligned and breaks structure alignment! Only
// table that seems to be unaligned in whole format...
//
// Data block is organized in such a way that it ends with aliased entries. Aliased entries point to same data offset, 
// there are always exactly three such pointers (2 defined in WHD, 1 is only defined in STR). There cannot be other 
// number of "duplicates" than 1 (none) or 3 (aiased entry, 1 entry split into 2 data-wise). It is almost certainly 
// split like this, as when one tries to compare this remove entry size, they find out that the size is the same as the sum
// of the other two. Offsets to specific data needs to be calculated in such a way that you subtract from last entry to first
// from complete WAV data block size. Each step, newly calculated offset should be anded with mask (~0xFF) so offset is aligned
// on 0x100 boundary from left. LIP data (if present) is non-zero remainder in front of data.
// 
// Completely all WAV data seems to be aligned, value seems to be same as STR_Header.dataBeginOffset but that may be
// a coincidence, relation unknown. Without aligning offsets though, mainly in case of data prepended with LIP, leads to
// broken exports. 
//
// For reading data starting with LIP, there is currently no better method (nor known if this is fully right) then to 
// treat such entries as concatenated and marking them as having LIP data.  This means getting whole WAV data block size
// and subtracting real data size from it, aligning offset on 0x100 from left.
