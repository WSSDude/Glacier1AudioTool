// Header partially defines structure of WHD+WAV files used by Hitman Contracts.
// It is specific for Hitman Contracts, it is written as simply as possible wihtout using anything fancy,
// with any information I had about each field written next to it.
//
// It represents sound data for specific scene with same name. They can't be opened without each other.
// Streams readability may be dependent on WHD information also, similiarly to other Glacier 1 games, needs to be checked.
